\begin{abstract}
The development of new theorical and technical means, particularly
in the field of computer science and its direct applications, leads
more and more to a renewal of the approach on design and architecture.
The increasing place of modeling and calculations in the architectural
process confirms that Architecture lays on the interface, in this
case ambiguous, between art and science.

The Venice variations : Interactions between generation and explanation}


\subsection*{1 Role of spatial analysis considerations in Design and Architectural
Knowledge}

Architecture and its narrative approach are direct consequences of
the geometric spatial configuration and an embodied experience, which
can be approximated through a topological description of space. That's
why geometry and topology play both key roles in architectural analysis
; they have in fact a strong relationship which form determine most
aspects of the architectural experience.

As a consequence, a useful tool of investigative modeling can be the
try of different geometric shapes associated with the same topology.
In that case, whereas the spatial integration stays the same (since
we define it in the classic way, with $N$ places and $d_{ij}$ the
topological distance from place $i$ to $j$, the mean accessibility
to other places : $I_{S}=\frac{2}{N\cdot(N-1)}\cdot\sum_{i<j}d_{ij}$
) because it depends only of the topological configuration, the visual
integration differs and is interesting to consider as a design criteria.
The visual integration can be defined as follows : the architectural
structure can be considered as a subset $A\subset P\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}$,
where $P$ is the part of the space we work in. Then the visual integration
of a point is the measure of the visually accessible subset taking
into account the architectural obstacles (walls). For $M\in P$, it
is defined as \[I_{v}(M)=\intop_{M'\in P \backslash S}{\mathbbm{1}_{\{M+t \vec{MM'}|t\in [0,1]\} \cap S = \emptyset} dS}\]

Density, Architecture and the City}


\subsection*{Why study density?}

Through history, density of cities has always have a great importance.
As a concrete example, there is evidence of the link between a high
density of population and health problems in Ansterdam, Jordean at
the end of the 19th century. At the same time, regulations to constraint
the height of buildings according to the street width were taken all
over the world (see Paris of \noun{Haussman} for example). The promoters
of the Garden City took the aspect of a healthier city as a main argument.
In the late 50s, Jacobs proposed (\cite{Jac56}) in opposition to
these idealisms a return to a more natural and by consequence a more
dense city.

Today, density can still be an issue. Back to the example of Amsterdam,
the global density is too low, as a consequence of an explosion of
the urban footprint, and of different relative growths of land uses
(the proportion of dwellings went bigger).

We could try to give an answer to the question of arguments for or
against densification, but there are very much pertinent arguments
on both side, so the really important aspect that appears is the study
of density in itself, the fact that it has good or bad consequences
on some aspects of the urban system is in fact an other problem, depending
most of the time on the particular concrete situation we are in.

Interaction between boundary shape and circulation structure in the
built environment}

Recent research work has been oriented towards the study of the mutual
effect of rules and constraints, in the sense of the relations between
the building shape and the social organization occupying it. These
two elements have totally different time longevity, so we can ask
if it could lead to contradictions between the functionnal aim of
an architecture and its effective use.

That lead to the study of two aspects and the links they have : the
boudary shape of the building and the contained circulation. Circulation
system is directly linked to a level of movement, and can be taken
as a local description of floorplates, whereas the boundaries are
more a global description. Such a study can also be done at the urban
scale, by searching the impacts of an imposed shape on internal circulations.

We will see here first the pure shape aspect, then the influence of
circulation on shape, and finally the inverse relation.

Biotic interferences}

This presentation is more on research in pure design than in spatial
analysis, but is closely linked to it because of the underlying systemic
approach in the design process. It presents a work of integrated design
lead by a multi-disciplinary team at KTH.
