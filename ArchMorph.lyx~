\begin_layout Abstract
The development of new theorical and technical means, particularly in the
 field of computer science and its direct applications, leads more and more
 to a renewal of the approach on design and architecture.
 The increasing place of modeling and calculations in the architectural
 process confirms that Architecture lays on the interface, in this case
 ambiguous, between art and science.

The Research Workshop Architectural Morphology: Investigative modeling and
 spatial analysis is meant as a beginning or a point of departure, in research
 and for coming events revolving around modeling and spatial analysis in
 architecture.
 With speakers of considerable repute within the field commonly referred
 to as Space Syntax, as well as in other Architectural fields, it is meant
 to communicate cutting edge analytical, configurative modeling as well
 as explore relations to other modeling and analytical traditions in architectur
al research.
 Furthermore, through the participation of AEDAS R&D and the experience
 of many of the speakers, the relation between modeling and analysis in
 research and practice will be highlighted and discussed.

 designed district in the sense that they are not liveable for a pedestrian,
 what is no more possible nowadays.
 Such designs present a strong lack of flexibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such errors could have been avoided by the use of analytic methods like
 spatial analysis, and we need today to switch from an exclusive descriptive
 approach of architecture to a normative point of view ; we need more normative,
 evidence-based practice.
 For example, back to the Atlanta districts, it can be showed through investigat
ive modeling that a greater building flexibility could have been permitted
 thanks to a non equivalent distribution of block size ; that can be put
 in parallel with the need for local activity diversification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course spatial analysis will never be the direct answer to the difficult
 question of what is an ideal city, but the motivation of space syntax has
 always been a normative aim through a better understanding of urban systems

\begin_layout Subsection*
1 Role of spatial analysis considerations in Design and Architectural Knowledge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Architecture and its narrative approach are direct consequences of the geometric
 spatial configuration and an embodied experience, which can be approximated
 through a topological description of space.
 That's why geometry and topology play both key roles in architectural analysis
 ; they have in fact a strong relationship which form determine most aspects
 of the architectural experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence, a useful tool of investigative modeling can be the try
 of different geometric shapes associated with the same topology.
 In that case, whereas the spatial integration stays the same (since we
 define it in the classic way, with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 places and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{ij}$
\end_inset

 the topological distance from place 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, the mean accessibility to other places : 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{S}=\frac{2}{N\cdot(N-1)}\cdot\sum_{i<j}d_{ij}$
\end_inset

 ) because it depends only of the topological configuration, the visual
 integration differs and is interesting to consider as a design criteria.
 The visual integration can be defined as follows : the architectural structure
 can be considered as a subset 
\begin_inset Formula $A\subset P\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is the part of the space we work in.
 Then the visual integration of a point is the measure of the visually accessibl
e subset taking into account the architectural obstacles (walls).
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $M\in P$
\end_inset

, it is defined as

 explains that imagination can be in fact considered as 
\shape italic
Ars combinatoria
\shape default
, that means finding one good configuration among all possibles.
 In other words, creating is exploring the plurality of words.
 The knowledge can be classified in 4 types : dialectic knowledge (empirical),
 encyclopedic knowledge (to make predictions), analytic knowledge (calculations)
 and creative knowledge (imagination) ; and design is in particular the
 combination of the last two : it joins these two different types of knowledge
 through functionnal aspect and the use of imagination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To go further in the role of computation in design, we can consider the
 work of Smithson in the 70s, and the concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Mat-building
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 developped particularly in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The important ideas are that architecture and urbanism are closely linked
 to the notion of emergence, and that an only top-down approach is not sufficien
t, a bottom-up approach is also needed, by considerations of evolutionnary
 fields and local relations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That importance of computers in design was later in the 90s confirmed by
 the apparition of evolutionnal design, e.
 g.
 design through genetic algorithm that use given rules of the genetic languages
 to compute new designs.
 That is again a botto-up approach for which the unpredictability of the
 emerging properties is inherent to the system and its self-organisation.

Density, Architecture and the City
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Why study density?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Through history, density of cities has always have a great importance.
 As a concrete example, there is evidence of the link between a high density
 of population and health problems in Ansterdam, Jordean at the end of the
 19th century.
 At the same time, regulations to constraint the height of buildings according
 to the street width were taken all over the world (see Paris of 
\noun on
Haussman
\noun default
 for example).
 The promoters of the Garden City took the aspect of a healthier city as
 a main argument.
 In the late 50s, Jacobs proposed (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Jac56"

\end_inset

) in opposition to these idealisms a return to a more natural and by consequence
 a more dense city.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today, density can still be an issue.
 Back to the example of Amsterdam, the global density is too low, as a consequen
ce of an explosion of the urban footprint, and of different relative growths
 of land uses (the proportion of dwellings went bigger).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We could try to give an answer to the question of arguments for or against
 densification, but there are very much pertinent arguments on both side,
 so the really important aspect that appears is the study of density in
 itself, the fact that it has good or bad consequences on some aspects of
 the urban system is in fact an other problem, depending most of the time
 on the particular concrete situation we are in.

Interaction between boundary shape and circulation structure in the built
 environment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recent research work has been oriented towards the study of the mutual effect
 of rules and constraints, in the sense of the relations between the building
 shape and the social organization occupying it.
 These two elements have totally different time longevity, so we can ask
 if it could lead to contradictions between the functionnal aim of an architectu
re and its effective use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That lead to the study of two aspects and the links they have : the boudary
 shape of the building and the contained circulation.
 Circulation system is directly linked to a level of movement, and can be
 taken as a local description of floorplates, whereas the boundaries are
 more a global description.
 Such a study can also be done at the urban scale, by searching the impacts
 of an imposed shape on internal circulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will see here first the pure shape aspect, then the influence of circulation
 on shape, and finally the inverse relation.

This presentation is more on research in pure design than in spatial analysis,
 but is closely linked to it because of the underlying systemic approach
 in the design process.
 It presents a work of integrated design lead by a multi-disciplinary team

1 Context of the work of Aedas R&D
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The company proposes to its client powerful applications of computational
 design and advanced spatial modeling to design problems, oriented towards
 sustainable solutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The models that are created can be at several different space scales, but
 also include people and their interactions between them and with their
 environment ; that can be seen as the switch from original space syntax
 to computational models for social logic [
\shape italic
Note : In fact, Aedas does in that case nothing more than complex social
 system modeling and analysis, but according to their client profile that
 are architects and designers, they market it as an evolution of space syntax

].

Study for masterplan
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to apply directly syntax to help design ; this example of
 project shows how a proposal of masterplan is done and how the designer
 can move pieces of it to see the consequences through the self-organisation
 of the rest of the plan.
 The modification can be done at different scales, from furnitures sometimes
 to the overall floor.

\begin_layout Standard
The construction of the new huge tower on the right bank of the Tamise in
 London has raised interrogations about its impact on the visual landscape
 of the city.
 The aim of that project was to model the visual impacts of that new landmark.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To do that, it is possible to calculate by ray-tracing if the tower is visible
 from a given point, what was done for a big part of the city for which
 the 3D data of building shapes were available.
 Then for each point, we can judge if the visible impact is significant,
 and also see the total proportion of places for which it has a real impact.
